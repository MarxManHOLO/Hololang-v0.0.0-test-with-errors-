HOLOlang is basic and easy language. It is 1.5x ~ 3.5x faster than Python and can be learned and coded as easily and simply as Python. It can be used in the following areas:
1) Game development
2) Scripting
3) Basic Computing Science
4) Education and Learning
5) Text, file and simple system operations
6) Network Management and Connection Tests
7) System Information Gathering and Reporting
8) Software Updates and Package Management
9) System automation
10) And much more than what is written above for programmers who can use this language correctly.


Language reuired libraries centeral include folder or lib folder. Examples of language usage are in the tests folder. After running the Makefile, a binary file named "hololang" will be created for you (tested on Linux). First of all, it is recommended to add the file to the PATH variable (with the lib folder and the necessary lib archive).

To use the language (we assume that it is assigned to the PATH variable):
$ hololang <filename.holo>

The libraries in the language are written with the language itself and their extensions are ".holos" -. Codes written in the Hololang language have the extension ".holo".
